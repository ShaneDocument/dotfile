# dotfile
## Quick Start
```
$ curl -sL install-node.vercel.app/lts | sudo bash # for coc.vim
$ git clone https://github.com/ShaneDocument/dotfile.git
$ cd dotfile
$ ./install.sh
```

## Feature
**The fewer plugins, the better.**
Currently, there are only three plugins:
1. NERDTree
2. Supertab
3. clang-format in vim
4. coc.vim

### vim
Most of the configurations are located in **.vimrc**. To get more informations, I suggest to read the code directly.

### tmux
Most of the configurations are located in **.tmux.conf**.


## TODO
1. vim-ls: "ls" in vim.
