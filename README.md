# dotfile
## Quick Start
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ShaneDocument/dotfile.git
$ cd dorfile
$ ./install.sh
```

## Feature
**The fewer plugins, the better.**
Currently, there are only three plugins:
1. NERDTree
2. Supertab
3. clang-format in vim

### vim
Most of the configurations are located in **.vimrc**. To get more informations, I suggest to read the code directly.

### tmux
Most of the configurations are located in **.tmux.conf**.


## TODO
1. Support clang-format: Currently, it doesn't support clang-format yet.
2. auto-backup: Auto backup the configuration before installing.
3. vim-ls: "ls" in vim.
